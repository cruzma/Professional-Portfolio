# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My professional portfolio is built using html and css. Main Features include CSS styling and CSS grid.

## Header

For the header i was able to use flex-end to position the nav at the far right of the screen then postion the nav at the center of the screen once screen size got smaller.



## Hero

For the hero section i was able to use Vh to cover the entire page of any screen

Able to center title in middle of screen using flexbox

Note i noticed the background image was not where i wanted it to be once screen got smaller.
    - i fixed that issue by addressing the background position in the media queries.
