# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My professional portfolio is built using html and css. Main Features include CSS styling and CSS grid.

## Header

For the header i was able to use flex-end to position the nav at the far right of the screen then postion the nav at the center of the screen once screen size got smaller.

## Hero

For the hero section i was able to use Vh to cover the entire page of any screen

Able to center title in middle of screen using flexbox

Note i noticed the background image was not where i wanted it to be once screen got smaller.
    - i fixed that issue by addressing the background position in the media queries.

## About Me

used flex box to but image and written content beside each other. Once screen got smaller I used flex-direction = column to put text underneath image.

## Work

Used Grid section to divide the baackground-images and always kept run-buddy as the biggest image no matter the screen size. Also continously changed the layout of the images to bettewr fit the screen.

## Contact me

used flexbox to have the content in row then switched to column as creen got smaller.

## footer

Used flexbox and space between spread the content across entire length of screen.
